# Babel Flight (standalone page)

The app is a single self-contained HTML page. Its source lives in `parts/`
(CSS, data and script pieces); `parts/order.txt` lists the assembly order.

Rebuild the page after editing any part:

    python3 babel-flight/parts/assemble.py src/babel-flight.html

`src/server.ts` serves `src/babel-flight.html` at `/` and fills in `%ORIGIN%`.

## Usage counting

`parts/f12_track.js` (standalone site only, never in the Claude version) sends an anonymous
visit / lesson-start ping to `/api/hit`: a random per-browser id plus language and mode.
The owner reads the totals at `/stats` (passphrase chosen on first visit).
Server side: `src/lib/analytics.server.ts`; schema: `migrations/0002_usage_stats.sql`.
